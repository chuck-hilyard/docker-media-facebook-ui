 - [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) - BDD test framework
 - [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html) - Unit test runner
 - [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/#/) - End to end test runner

## Setup
```
$ npm install
```

## Commands

- `$ npm start` Start local server at http://localhost:4000
- `$ npm run build` Build /dist directory
- `$ npm run lint` Lint js and scss files
- `$ npm run start:test` Start local server with mocked gateway calls
- `$ npm run test:e2e` Run protractor tests*
- `$ npm run test:unit` Run karma tests


*Requires `npm start:test` to already be running

## RL SSO Module
Located in `/src/app/common/rl-sso` this module will handle the authentication with ReachLocal services. It listens for 401 responses and will open an authentication modal when needed.

## Translations
See [Angular Translate](https://angular-translate.github.io/) for more information. Translation are configured and ran from `/src/app/root.module.js`
#### Additional Languages
Additional languages should be added to root module. Add the new language translation to the provider. *ie* `.translations('xx', xx)`.

This will also require the additional language objects be imported in the root modules as well. See `/src/app/lang-en.js` for an example of how to construct a translation object.
#### Language Select
`rl-language-select` component can be added to any view to switch between languages. It is recommended to place it in the sidebar or footer. The component will set a cookie to remember a users language preference.

## Unit Testing
Unit test are written in Jasmine and run by Karma. The test files (`*.spec.js`) should be placed in the same directory as the file it is intended to test.  

## [End to End Testing (e2e)](https://github.com/reachlocal/search-campaigns-client/blob/master/test/README.md)
E2e tests are also written in Jasmine but run by protractor. See the [e2e readme](https://github.com/reachlocal/search-campaigns-client/blob/master/test/README.md) for more details.
